We seek to build a application for use by our SigRho Treasurer. To begin we will enumerate all objects which may potentially be used
Objects: Budget, master_balance, transactions (withdrawals, deposits)
	- Budget
		+ properties: budget_amount, account_balance, ledger_balance, budget_name, active_officer, parent_budget (if null, budget is master)
		+ methods: (getters/setters)
	- transaction
		+ propertes: amount, name, description, associated_budget, is_settled
		+ methods: (getters, setters)

Functionality: make transactions which are initially simply marked in the leger_balance but are then are marked in account_balance if settled,
view all transactions (for any budget), mark as settled, display all unsettled transactions
